## My Return To The Heights  

Things really blew up when I returned to The Heights from Tahiti. <br>

Things on the island were so peaceful so I had forgotten how intense things could get on the radio. <br>

## The Messenger  

In cancelling the apocalypse I came in contact with and experienced many other worldly beings and artifacts. <br>

This man in the helmet was a special visitor who was unable to get his message to me until 6 months later in December. <br>

I received the message while creating this website. After uploading the pictures and since learning how to communicate with spirits and special beings in photographs I reached in and they were eager to respond. <br>
I was initially skeptical, both of my ability to talk through a photograph as well as with the identity of the being. I satisfied any doubt by asking questions about when this was, how they got here, who they were, what they knew and how they got to know it. <br>

## The Message

_"Your wife is pregnant."_ - he announced with a rushed congratulation.
_"You have to return to the island immediately!"_

The conversation crossed topics from the physical to the metaphysical. They had traveled across the equator and changed sized in doing so. <br>
I have no reason to believe they are any different than the other holographic peoples.

Here the body is outlined to make it standout more. <br>
Following their arm, they appear to be grabbing their abdomen or back as though it was in pain or sore from a recent trauma. <br>
It could also look like a wing behind his shoulder - as though it were an angel from cultural depriction. <br>
